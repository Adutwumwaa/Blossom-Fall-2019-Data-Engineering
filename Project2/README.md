Batch Processing For Data Mining.

This project investigates top keywords companies within various cities in the US want to see in the resumes of data science candidates. We used PySpark as our data processing frame work in this project. The project demonstrated the following:

Loaded data from s3 bucket,read and joined the datasets with pyspark. Wrote a function to generate n-grams (unigram and bigram) from a given text description and wrote a function to check frequency count of a given ngram in a column. Used matplotlib for simple visualization to compare datascience jobs in two cities.
